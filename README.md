## Feature Engineering and Model Selection in Machine Learning
Welcome to the Feature Engineering and Model Selection repository! This repository explores the implementation of common feature engineering techniques and model selection strategies used in the process of building robust and efficient machine learning models. It serves as a practical guide for data preprocessing, feature transformation, and choosing the right algorithms to enhance model performance.

### Objectives
This repository aims to:

- Provide hands-on implementations of feature engineering techniques to improve data quality and relevance.
- Demonstrate various approaches to selecting the best models for given datasets.
- Highlight the impact of feature selection and transformation on machine learning model performance.
- Serve as a resource for learning and applying effective preprocessing and model selection techniques in real-world projects.
